      content='The Algo Vision project is an extensive
    algorithm visualizer with the goal of enabling humans to understand and
    experience the beauty of algorithms past the zeroes and ones. It has been
    proven that humans respond and process visual data better than any other
    form of data. In fact, the human computer (the brain) processes images
    60,000 times faster than plain text. Humans are so visually oriented that 90
    percent of information transmitted to the brain is visual. Hence, Algo
    Vision was created as a form of "translator", which relays computer
    processed data into a human comprehensible one. Therefore, as you interact
    with the program, I urge you to realize the artistry of mere zeroes and ones
    orchestrated to optimize the world.'

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
